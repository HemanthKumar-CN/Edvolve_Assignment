## Technologies

The tech used are:

- Reactjs
- Chakra UI/icons for styling

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- cd assgn-1
- npm start

## Approach

- I started by fetching data from github api by attaching a query parameter searching for the required Repository.
- Pagination is added by updating state, and every time page number is updated, an api call is made to fetch data.
- The search input value is obtained using useRef()(to avoid unnecessary re-rendering).
- Debouncing functionality is added to search a particular issue.
